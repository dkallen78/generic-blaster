# [Bounty Blaster v0.01](https://dkallen78.github.io/generic-blaster/blaster-02.html)

I finally taught myself how to use requestAnimationFrame. It makes things move along much faster. I'm also organizing my code better because the last version was a mess.

## Details

Map size: 720w x 960h

Ship/enemy size 32 x 32

## Previous versions

### [Generic Blaster v0.02](https://dkallen78.github.io/generic-blaster/blaster-02/blaster-01.html)

This is the evolution of the first test I did. It has more functionality and evolved to the point of having music and sfx along with multiple enemies. It still uses the setTimeout function to handle the game loop.

### [Generic Blaster v0.01](https://dkallen78.github.io/generic-blaster/blaster-01/blaster.html)

These were the initial tests I was doing to make a ship move around on the screen. There were some things I didn't like about how my classes were structured and rather than trying to fix a bunch of stuff at once I rebuilt it from the basic principles of this teplate.
