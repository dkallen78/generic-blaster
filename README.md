I finally taught myself how to use requestAnimationFrame. It makes things move along much faster. I'm also organizing my code better because the last version was a mess.

This is the evolution of the first test I did. It has more functionality and evolved to the point of having music and sfx along with multiple enemies. It still uses the setTimeout function to handle the game loop.

These were the initial tests I was doing to make a ship move around on the screen. There were some things I didn't like about how my classes were structured and rather than trying to fix a bunch of stuff at once I rebuilt it from the basic principles of this teplate.
